        Roller skating is the act of traveling on surfaces with roller skates.
        It is a recreational activity, a sport, and a form of transportation.
        Roller rinks and skate parks are built for roller skating, though it
        also takes place on streets, sidewalks, and bike paths.
        <br /><br />Roller skating originated in the performing arts in the 18th
        century. It gained widespread popularity starting in the 1880s. Roller
        skating was very popular in the United States from the 1930s to the
        1950s, then again in the 1970s when it was associated with disco music
        and roller discos. During the 1990s, inline outdoor roller skating
        became popular. Roller skating has often been a part of Black and LGBT
        history in particular. Sport roller skating includes
        <span class="skating-activities">speed skating</span>,
